					Donations of all kinds and all amounts are welcome. FISSION

					College of Sofia who give it their all to make the fair a
					success. Any support from parents, other students, guests,
					organizations, and friends is highly appreciated and valued
					by our team. The funds donated to the fair will be used to
					provide a better experience for all who attend FISSION. This
					includes more space for all participants, more activities
					and challenges, more food stands and more.{" "}

					Thank you for all of your support and we will do our very
					best to bring the most pleasant experience possible. If you
