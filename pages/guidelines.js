				<h2>Teams Formation</h2>
				<p>
					Each team consists of 1-3 members. There are no restrictions
					on the backgrounds of teammates such as which school they
					attend apart from the requirment that no team member should
					have progressed to high school in case the team competes in
					the Junior Category.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>
						Teams with projects that have participated in other
						competitions are also encouraged to join.
					</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					<i>
						Please note that whether students from the American
						College of Sofia in teams of three will be able to claim
						their bonuses is still subject to discussion.
					</i>
				</p>
				<h2>Categories</h2>
				<p>
					Make sure to become familiar with the requirements for your
					category before submitting the registration form. The
					projects taking part in FISSION are divided in six
					categories:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Biomedical, Biological, and Chemical Sciences: </b>
						Projects concerning Biology, Chemistry Biochemistry,
						Biotechnology, Medicine and Pharmacology.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Computer Science:</b> Projects concerning
						Informatics, Software Engineering, Digital Electronics,
						Computer Simulations, Algorithms, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Mathematics:</b> Projects concerning Algebra,
						Geometry, Arithmetics, Combinatorics, as well as
						projects investigating the fields of Economics,
						Statistics, and Finance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ecology and Environmental Science: </b>Includes, but
						is not limited to projects concerned with Modern-day
						issues such as depleting the ozone layer, pollution of
						soils, waters, and air.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Physical Sciences and Engineering: </b>Projects
						concerning Physics, Astrophysics, Astronomy,
						Nano-science, Materials Science, and Geology, together
						with Engineering.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Junior Category: </b>Projects of teams that have not
						yet entered high school. However, middle school students
						may still choose to compete in one of the other
						categories if they wish.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Each project within each category may be one of the
					following types:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Experiment</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Working Model</b>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					All projects must compete in one category only. Students
					with projects from intermediate disciplines (Bioinformatics,
					Biophysics, Neuroscience, Palaeontology), as well projects
					using methods, or ideas from many areas must choose the
					category they think their project fits best in.
				</p>
				<h2> Experiment </h2>
				<p>
					An experiment is a research of a question in an attempt to
					prove an arguable answer of it (a hypothesis). All
					experiments should have a clearly stated question and an
					arguable hypothesis (do not try to prove a fact). The
					question guiding the investigation should be relevant to
					modern scientific or industrial issues. All participants
					must have a Lab Report at the fair. It should include the
					following sections:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Abstract (100-200 word summary)</li>
					<li>
						Stated research question, hypothesis, variables and
						constants
					</li>
					<li>Background Research</li>
					<li>Materials</li>
					<li>Procedure</li>
					<li>Data and Analysis</li>
					<li>Discussion</li>
					<li>Conclusion</li>
					<li>Further Research Questions</li>
					<li>
						References / Work-Cited Page: a MLA-format citations of
						all the sources of information you used. For more info
						on, MLA please visit:{" "}
						<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">
							Purdue
						</a>{" "}
						or <a href="https://www.easybib.com/">EasyBib</a>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					All authors of experiments must bring a report at the fair.
					It is not mandatory for the presentation to follow the
					report exactly, but we recommend communicating the most
					important points. You can also have a separate copy of the
					report in the form of a booklet. In the presentation, you
					need to summarize your research question and hypothesis, the
					procedure you used for the investigation, the data you
					collected, the results of your research and the conclusions
					that you reached. You may also mention noteworthy
					information about the references you consulted, your
					materials, modifications you made or challenges you
					experienced. You may also emphasise the importance of your
					investigation and point out what studies you think should
					follow this experiment. You can find more information about
					what each part should include{" "}

					.
				</p>
				<h2>Working Model</h2>
				<p>
					A working model is a portable construction of a mechanism or
					an invention that does certain work. This project type may
					include robots, machines, electronic devices, computer
					programs, etc. The invention MUST do some work and have some
					application. In the presentation, participants need to
					summarize the background research, the device they are
					demonstrating, and its wider purpose.
					<br />
					Incorporate all the capabilities of your model into your
					presentation. Also discuss the process of construction, the
					materials, modifications made, challenges experienced, or
					things you would do different if you were to do this project
					again. Models are displayed on the project tables alongside
					your posters. If there are any circumstances which hinder
					the live demonstration of your project, you must provide a
					video of the working model and a thorough explanation. The
					video should be with you at the fair on a flash drive.
				</p>
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<p>At FISSION, all participants MUST:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Be able to present their projects orally before the
						judges and answer questions about their project. Each
						presentation must be in English, and its duration should
						be between 5 and 10 minutes. It is to be followed by a
						five-minute period in which the jurors can ask
						questions. Participants who are not confident with their
						English may use a language helper provided by us.
					</li>
					<li>
						Additionally:
						<ul>
							<li>
								All participants, regardless of the category in
								which they compete, may prepare a video
								demonstrating and explaining their work (model
								or experiment) that is to be sumbitted before
								the respective deadline and that should be of
								appropriate length. However, a live
								demonstration is preferable.
							</li>
							<li>
								All who participate with an Experiment must have
								a lab report of their work. These reports are
								needed for the jury to determine the winning
								project in each type and must be submitted
								before the respective deadline.
							</li>
							<li>
								All who participate with a Working Model must
								provide a report with the working principles and
								materials of their model, which are needed for
								the jury to determine the winning project in
								each type. This report should be submitted
								before the respective deadline.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						For further instructions, check the rubric tables down
						below:
